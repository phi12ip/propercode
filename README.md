# Proper Code

The goal of Proper Code is to teach everyone how to use computers to magnify their impact, no matter their background.

We will meet you where you are and help you get to where you want to be. 

Just based on what we specialize in, we offer tracks based around web development and operations. 

Currently, we offer one track. The web full-stack development track. This is just for now. Rome wasn't built in one day (: 

The web track assumes that you have some familiarity with computer programming and are maybe coming from Python or have done some web development in the past but want to dive deeper or get up to speed with modern techniques. 


In the future we hope to provide material to guide a complete beginer to any level of mastery they would like.

## Web Development

[Learning Documentation](./docs)

In the world of web development there are two main categories of engineers:
* front-end
* back-end

Front-end enginners work on the stuff that the user sees, and the backend engineers work on the stuff that supplies the information for the front end to use. 

In the past there were completely different stacks used in the development of these technologies. The backned may be built by Cold Fussion, PHP, ASP, or others and the front-end was a mix of HTML for markup or structure, CSS for stying , and JS for any dynamic content. 

Nowadays, we try to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript when we are working with Web as much as possible. We do this by using Node to build our server side apps because this reduces the context switching that we must do when developing web apps.
