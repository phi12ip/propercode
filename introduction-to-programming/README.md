# Introduction to programming using Java

## Preface

Hello and welcome! You have taken the first and most important step to getting started in software development: taking the leep and believing in yourself. This course is meant to start establishing your programming toolbox, and start from a strong foundation for future learning.

Software development is a unique because of the relationship between the computer and the programmer. Software is a framework of ideas and abstractions, but it is also the mechanism to complete those actions.

## About this course

This course will roughly follow a first semester course in programming typically taught in a university. 

Typically in these programs, the student is required to take a "Technology Seminar" class to get a sampling of technology and it's uses in modern society. Topics covered include: what the Internet is; and how this differs from the Web, cloud computing, mobile devices, Internet of Things, etc. 

I believe that these are important things to understand, but are abstractions built on top of software, and have the risk of poluting the a priori concepts in programming. In fact, the first programer, Ada Lovelace, wrote programs 100 years before any machines existed to execute them.

To be successful in this series of lessons, there are a few skills that are important to start off with. First of all, you should feel comfortable using a computer. By this I mean comfortably navigating around your filesystem, checking email and browsing the web, and having the ablity to look up online what you're not sure how to do. For example, "How do I prevent X program from starting when the computer starts?"

Beyond these digital literacy skills, typing skills can really make a difference in the long haul. I would recomend commiting yourself to be disciplined and stick to touch typing. With touch typing, you don't look away from the screen, and your fingers always return to the same resting place. By relying on mussle memory, and not rellying on typing words at a time, you're able to level-up your skills in typing speed and accuracy. Also, programming involves using many special characters interspersed into regular words. If you don't break the habbit early, you will find yourself always looking forthe . , / " ' () {} characters, and this will interfere with your thought process and slow you down.
