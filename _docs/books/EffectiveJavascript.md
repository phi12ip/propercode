# Effective Javascript Notes

## Items

### Item 1: Know Which JavaScript You Are Using

Things to Remember: 

- Decide which versions of JavaScript your application supports.
- Be sure that any JavaScript features you use are supported by all environments where your application runs.
- Always test strict code in environments that perform the strict-mode checks.
- Beware of concatenating scripts that differ in their expectations about strict mode.

### Item 2: Understand JavaScriptâ€™s Floating-Point Numbers

Things to Remember:

- JavaScript numbers are double-precision floating-point numbers.
- Integers in JavaScript are just a subset of doubles rather than a separate datatype.
- Bitwise operators treat numbers as if they were 32-bit signed integers.
- Be aware of limitations of precisions in floating-point arithmetic.

### Item 3: Beware of Implicit Coercions

Things to Remember:

- Type errors can be silently hidden by implicit coercions.
- The + operator is overloaded to do addition or string concatenation depending on its argument types.
- Objects are coerced to numbers via valueOf and to strings via toString.
- Objects with valueOf methods should implement a toString method that provides a string representation of the number produced by valueOf.
- Use typeof or comparison to undefined rather than truthiness to test for undefined values.

### Item 4: Prefer Primitives to Object Wrappers

Things to Remember:

- Object wrappers for primitive types do not have the same behavior as their primitive values when compared for equality.
- Getting and setting properties on primitives implicitly creates object wrappers.
